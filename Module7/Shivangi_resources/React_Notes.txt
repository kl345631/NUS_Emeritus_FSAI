What is a Frontend Framework?
A frontend framework is a ready-made structure + tools + rules that help developers build:
Fast, Interactive, Scalable, Single-page applications


Why Frontend Frameworks Were Created?
Problem 1: Websites used to refresh on every click
Problem 2: Code became unmanageable
Problem 3: Performance issues
Problem 4: Different browsers behave differently


Student Feature:  	Framework Benefit:

Live order status	Reactive state management
Search restaurants	Fast rendering
Filters			Components
Login/Logout		Routing
Cart			Data binding
Map on homepage		Third-party integration

How Frontend Frameworks Work Internally?
STEP 1: Component-Based Architecture
STEP 2: Virtual DOM / Optimized DOM
STEP 3: Routing

How Virtual DOM Works?
Step 1 → React creates a virtual copy of the UI -> A JavaScript object representing your UI.

Step 2 → When something changes -> React updates the Virtual DOM, not the real DOM.

Step 3 → Diffing (Compare both DOMs)
React checks -> What changed? Which component updated?

Step 4 → Update ONLY the changed part in the real DOM -> Not the whole page — just the piece that changed.

This is called Reconciliation.








Component-Based Design:

Component-Based Design means breaking your UI into small, reusable, independent pieces called components.
Examples of components:

Navbar, Button, SearchBar, ProductCard, Footer, ChatMessage, Sidebar, LoginForm

Each component:
1) has its own structure
2) has its own design
3) has its own logic
4) can be reused anywhere




How Components Work Internally (Simple Version)

A component has 3 parts:
1. Structure (HTML / JSX) -> Defines how it looks.  -> JSX -> javascript xml

2. Style (CSS) -> Defines the design.

3. Logic (JS) -> Defines how it behaves.




<h1 id="head1"></h1>

<script>
  document.getElementById("head1").innerHTML = "I am heading";
</script>




function heading1(){
  return (
    <h1>I am heading </h1>
)

}











Single-Page Applications:
A web application that loads only one HTML page, and updates content dynamically without full page reload.
Browsers don’t refresh the entire page; only a specific part updates.




MERN: MongoDB Express.js React.js Node.js
1) It is Open Source
2) It supports modern applications
3) It uses JavaScript everywhere(frontend+backend+node.js)

MongoDB -> NoSQL(stores the data in JSON format, document oriented) -> database
{
  "name": "john",
  "email": "john123@gmail.com"
}

Express.js -> backend web framework for Node.js
1) Helps create APIs and handle HTTP request easily.

React.js -> Frontend library for building user Interface
1) Uses components and state to build interactive user Interface.
example: 
function greet()
{
  return <h1> hello </h1>
}

Node.js -> JavaScript runtime environment(run JS outside browser)
1) Used to build the server-side of the applications
2) Handle requests, run Express.js and connect to MongoDB.




NODE.JS -> NPM  ->

MONGO DB -> DEPENDENCIES
EXPRESS.JS -> DEPENDENCIES
REACT.JS -> DEPENDENCIES


NPM INSTALL MONGODB, EXPRESSJS












HOW MERN WORKS Together? What is the Flow?
1) User(Frontend) -> Interact with React -> login
2) React -> sends request to Express.js API(via fetch or axios)
3) Express.js(running in Node.js) -> process request , interact with MongoDB
4) MongoDB -> Returns data to Express.js
5) Express.js-> sends response back to react.
6) React -> Updates the UI with the new data.


Creat REACT APP using CRA(old) or VITE(new):
CRA -> CREATE-REACT-APP: npm or npx create-react-app appname
npm start
vite -> fast: npm create vite@latest appname
npm run dev


App.jsx ->main.jsx -> index.html
