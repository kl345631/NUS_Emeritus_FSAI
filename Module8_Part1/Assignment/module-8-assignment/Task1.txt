1a) Write a brief explanation of React’s core features: component-based architecture, Virtual DOM, and unidirectional data flow. 
component-based architecture – reusable codes called components
virtual DOM – Document Object Model, in memory copy of the real DOM. 
Unidirectional data flow – data flowing in one direction from parent to child component via props. 

1b) Discuss why these features make React ideal for building modern web applications.
These features allows code and web applications to be scalable, easy to maintain and debug, faster and responsive.
